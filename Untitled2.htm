		<p>Varanasi is well connected by train and bus, with multiple of each heading in every direction daily. The trains and buses are dirty and overcrowded by Western standards. The people, however, are warm and accomodate westerners who are unfamiliar with their customs and don't take offense when you don't follow their ways.</p>
	
<h2> By Train </h2>

<p>Trains are the easiest way to reach Varanasi, with multiple daily services to cities including Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, Mumbai and Kolkata.
Varanasi is served by two major railway stations. Many trains arrive at Varanasi Junction (IR station code : BSB) in the heart of the city, and many others arrive at Mughal Sarai Junction (IR station code : MGS), about 15 km east of the city (Rs 20, 45 min in a rickshaw). Of course,these prices change as the Rupee changes in value.Here is a list of useful trains to reach Varanasi:</p>

<h2> By Bus </h2>

<p>There are daily buses to the Nepali border and other points around northern India. Local buses leave from the main bus station near the train station, almost every hour in the morning and one in the evening, to Gorakhpur (5-6 hrs, Rs 120), from where buses leave to the Nepali border at Sonauli (~3 hrs, Rs 56).
There are buses run by state government from Lucknow (8hrs), Kanpur (9hrs - Rs. 195) and Allahabad(3hrs - Rs. 88)</p>

<h2> By Plane </h2>

<p>Varanasi Airport (IATA: VNS) is about 25km from the city center. Indian Airlines [2], Jet Airways/JetLite [3], Kingfisher [4] and SpiceJet [5] all have daily flights to Delhi and there are daily flights to Mumbai on JetLite ,Indian Airlines and SpiceJet.
Allow plenty of time to get to the airport, it can take an hour or more depending on traffic. A taxi should run around Rs 600-700 or about Rs 125 in an auto-rickshaw, but most drivers will want to charge double since they will likely be coming back empty.</p></div>
