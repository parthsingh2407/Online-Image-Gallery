Quotes :
	"Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together!" - Mark Twain

"The city illumines truth and reveals reality.   It does not bring new wonders into the scope of vision, but enables one to see what is alrealdy there.  Where this eternal light intersects the earth, it is known as Kashi (Varanasi)". - Diana L. Eck
